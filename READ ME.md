# Make A Transaction (Code Assessment)

Hello and thank you for the opportunity, here's the result of the code assessment

  - Project results are in the dist folder
  - Source code available in the src folder
  - Using AngularJS 1.7.X (1.5.X was requested during the assessment), Angular Route, SASS, Bootstrap and Gulp (3.9.1)
  - 12 Hours took between project setup and development
  - Functional and non-functional requirements were addressed along with the technology restrictions

### Installation

Install the dependencies, install gulp global in order to run the server (this will open the project in a new browser tab)

```sh
$ cd transferApp
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp@3.9.1
$ gulp start
```
If gulp start gives you trouble:

Make sure that your local gulp fits to your CLI installation.

```sh
$ npm install gulp@3.9.1
$ npm install -g gulp@3.9.1
$ gulp start
```

gulp start will build and copy all the required files in order to start using the app.

### Development

The first step of the development process was setting up the whole folder structure, along with the task runner and the dependiencies that were going to be used during the whole process.

The second was addressing the design and trying to pull a desktop markup in order to get into the functional requirements.

In the second step gulp was a big help getting all the assets and different files in order inside the dist folder, also implementing browser-sync helped to speedup the whole flow.

The third and final step was getting and the functional requirments with restrictions and code improvements along the way, ending with using the bootstrap breakpoints to get a responsive view.

There are certain visual defects that I wasn't able to address completely due to my time but I've focused on getting all the requirements from the assessment done and tested.

## Thank you for your time!
